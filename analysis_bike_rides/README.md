# Homework 1: Data Analysis Basics


## Problem
Obtain the CSV (comma separated variable) file containing the counts of bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012 (as described in https://data.seattle.gov/browse?category=Transportation&limitTo=datasets&utf8=%E2%9C%93). Create directories for data and analysis. Download the data from https://data.seattle.gov/resource/4xy5-26gy.csv put it in the data directory. Create an iPython Notebook to analyze these data called 'Homework1.ipynb'. In the notebook: (1) Select the 2015 data, creating a new dataframe with fields for date, hour, and count, and use these data in questions (2)-(4); (2) use python matplotlib to plot the counts by hour;  (3) compute the hourly average counts; and (4) determine what is the busiest hour of the day. 

## Hints
The “date” field is a string coded as “yyyy-mm-dd-Thh” where “yyyy” is the year, “mm” is the month, “dd” is the day, and “hh” is the hour. (You’ll need to write python code to decode the strings.)
