## linear_svm
This repository provides examples of how to use the linear support vector machine method with squared hinge loss regularization. See the **examples folder** for an example with simulated data and an example with the Spam email data.  
  
As shown in the demo file, the Spam data can be downloaded from this website:   
  >  https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.data.   
    
And the response or test_indicator, _i.e_. whether the email is Spam or not, can be found at:   
  >  https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.traintest.    
  
In order to run the code, you first need to install these modules:
> matplotlib  
> numpy  
> pandas  
> scipy  
> sklearn
  
It's best to install the libraries with Anaconda, rather than installing them with pip, so you get all the  
dependency modules that are required for each of these libraries.
